This repository contains the code and data associated with the paper titled "Numerical Simulation of the 2D Trajectory of a Non-Buoyant Fluid Parcel under the Influence of Inertial Oscillation" by Herho et al. (2024).

## Overview

The study investigates the trajectory of a non-buoyant fluid parcel subjected to inertial oscillations, a phenomenon of profound relevance in geophysical fluid dynamics. The simulations were implemented using multiple open-source programming languages, including Fortran 95, Python, GNU Octave, R, and Julia, to facilitate transparency, reproducibility, and collaborative development.
